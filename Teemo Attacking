        Here Idea is at each step
        we have to perform two operations
            1.first is to add duration to answer
            2.and if overlapping then reduce that interval
            
        Now question is how to check overlapping?
        if currNo + duration gt next no curr no
            then overlapping duration is 
            (currNo + duration) - next no
