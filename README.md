This is second directory because github reached limit of no of files for first repo "DSA_Problem_Solving"

388. Arranging Coins => this is classic binary search problem
389. Remove Duplicate Letters => using stack,track of last idx and its visited status lot of things are involved here
390. Teemo Attacking => simple linear time observation based problem
391. Maximum Frequency Stack => this is one of the best problem with stack of stack approach I solved
392. Relative Ranks => clubbing elements and indices then sort them by elemets and prepare answer
393. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I => kinda brainteaser problem with only observations.
394. Reverse String II => just reverse then windows and go ahead
395. Array Partition I => this is also observation based easy problem
396. Binary Tree Tilt => simple postorder problem
397. Longest Harmonious Subsequence => simple hashmap and sorting problem
398. Construct String from Binary Tree => little ambiguous problem but simple preorder traversal will solve the issue
399. Robot Return to Origin => very simple problem 
400. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree => little tricky but did in brute force way
401. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence => this is very simple sliding winow problem
402. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row => this is very good observation based problem
403. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String => classic stack problem same as balanced parenthesis
404. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II => this is another advanced problem on the top of this.
405. Sort stack using another stack(sp - gfg) => very simple problem
406. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value => this is classic Observation based problem VVIMP
407. Previous smaller element, Next Greater Element => very simple problem using stack
408. Broken Calculator => this is reverse thinking problem 
409. Maximal Rectangle => using largest historgram problem we can solve this
410. MAX and MIN(sp) => sum of (max - min) of all subarrays of array VERy good problem can be solved using contributions and NGE,NSE,PGE,PSE
411. Boats to Save People => very simple sorting and two pointer problem
412. Binary Number with Alternating Bits => get prev and current bit and compare
413. Two City Scheduling => totally observation based problem..
414. N integers containing only 1, 2 & 3(sp - leetcode[Numbers At Most N Given Digit Set]) => this is classic queue problem
415. Perfect Numbers - Find Nth even length palindromic number formed using digits X and Y(sp - gfg) => this also is classic queue problem
416. Reversing Elements Of Queue(sp -gfg) +> this can be done using 3 steps
417. Valid Palindrome II => this is greedy problem with two edge cases
418. Sum of min and max(sp - gfg) => this problem is extension of sliding window maximum and minimum and their addition
419. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II=> same problem with duplicate edge case move both ptrs if values are same
420. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal => very simple problem
421.
